# Solar_Array_Classifcations

Senior Capstone Project at Denison University. Made use of Convolutional Neural Networks and Deep Belief Networks and compared their efficiency on classifying satellite images containing solar arrays from the surface of the United States

Data has been obtained for this project in the form of satellite images from the USGS NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) satellite. This is availible open source, however, not included in this respository due to size of individual images.

*** Note *** The DBN code has been removed from the repository due to its inability to run correctly at this time
